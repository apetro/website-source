# website-source

Source for my apetro.github.io site.

## Building

This site builds using eleventy.

For local testing, 

`eleventy --serve`

To publish to GitHub pages, you then commit the (changes in) the resulting built site to the `apetro.github.io` repository.

If you have that repository checked out parallel to this, that's

`eleventy --output=../apetro.github.io`
